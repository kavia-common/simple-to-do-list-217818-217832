## Core Features

### Adding Tasks

Creating new tasks is quick and intuitive:

1. **Locate the input field** at the top of the application
2. **Type your task title** (up to 200 characters)
3. **Press Enter** or click the "Add" button
4. The task appears immediately in your task list
5. The input field clears automatically, ready for your next task

**Tips for adding tasks:**

- Keep task titles concise and actionable
- Use specific language (e.g., "Buy groceries" instead of "Shopping")
- Empty or whitespace-only entries are automatically prevented
- New tasks appear at the bottom of your list by default

### Viewing Tasks

All your tasks are displayed in a clear, readable list format:

- **Task Title**: The main text describing your task
- **Completion Status**: Visual indicator showing whether the task is complete or incomplete
- **Action Icons**: Edit and delete buttons for each task

**Visual Indicators:**

- **Incomplete tasks**: Display with normal styling and an empty checkbox
- **Completed tasks**: Show with strikethrough text and a checked checkbox
- **Empty state**: When you have no tasks, a friendly message encourages you to add your first task

### Completing Tasks

Marking tasks as complete helps you track your progress:

1. **Click the checkbox** next to any task
2. The task is immediately marked as complete with visual feedback
3. Completed tasks display with strikethrough text
4. Your completion count updates in real-time
5. Click the checkbox again to mark the task as incomplete

**What happens when you complete a task:**

- The task remains in your list (it's not deleted)
- Visual styling changes to indicate completion
- Task counts update automatically
- Your progress is saved to browser storage

### Editing Tasks

Need to update a task? Editing is seamless:

1. **Click the edit icon** (pencil/notepad) next to the task
2. The task title becomes editable
3. **Make your changes** to the text
4. **Press Enter** to save, or **click outside** the field
5. **Press Escape** to cancel and discard changes

**Editing rules:**

- You cannot save an empty task title
- Edited tasks retain their completion status and position
- Changes are saved automatically to browser storage
- Visual feedback indicates when a task is in edit mode

### Deleting Tasks

Remove tasks you no longer need:

1. **Click the delete icon** (trash bin or X) next to the task
2. The task is removed immediately
3. No confirmation prompt—deletion is instant
4. The task is permanently removed from browser storage
5. Task counts update automatically

**Important notes about deletion:**

- Deleted tasks cannot be recovered
- Use the "Complete" feature instead if you want to keep a record
- Consider using filters to hide completed tasks rather than deleting them

## Advanced Features

### Filtering Tasks

Focus on specific tasks using the filter controls:

**Filter Options:**

- **All**: View all tasks regardless of completion status (default view)
- **Active**: Show only incomplete tasks that need attention
- **Completed**: Display only tasks you've finished

**How to use filters:**

1. Click one of the filter buttons (All/Active/Completed)
2. The task list updates instantly to show only matching tasks
3. Task counts reflect the active filter
4. Your filter selection persists during your session

**When to use filters:**

- Use "Active" to focus on what still needs to be done
- Use "Completed" to review your accomplishments
- Use "All" to see your complete task history

### Clearing Completed Tasks

Declutter your list by removing all completed tasks at once:

1. Complete some tasks to enable the feature
2. Look for the "Clear Completed" button in the footer
3. Click the button to remove all completed tasks
4. All incomplete tasks remain unaffected

**Important considerations:**

- This action cannot be undone
- The button only appears when you have completed tasks
- Use this feature regularly to keep your list manageable
- Consider whether you want to keep completed tasks for records before clearing

### Task Counts

The application displays helpful statistics:

- **Total Tasks**: The complete count of all tasks in your list
- **Active Tasks**: Number of incomplete tasks remaining
- **Completed Tasks**: Number of tasks you've finished

These counts update in real-time as you add, complete, or delete tasks. When using filters, counts reflect the filtered view.

## Tips and Best Practices

### Staying Organized

**Start your day right:**

- Review your task list each morning
- Add new tasks as they come to mind
- Prioritize by reordering (add most important tasks first)

**Keep tasks manageable:**

- Break large projects into smaller, actionable tasks
- Use specific, verb-based language ("Write report" vs. "Report")
- Set realistic daily goals

**Regular maintenance:**

- Clear completed tasks weekly
- Review and update task titles as needed
- Delete outdated or no-longer-relevant tasks

### Maximizing Productivity

**Quick capture:**

- Add tasks immediately when you think of them
- Don't worry about perfect wording—you can edit later
- Use the Enter key for rapid task entry

**Stay focused:**

- Use the "Active" filter to see only what needs attention
- Complete tasks as you finish them for immediate satisfaction
- Review completed tasks occasionally to track progress

**Prevent overwhelm:**

- Don't let your list grow too large (aim for 10-20 active tasks)
- Use "Clear Completed" regularly to maintain a clean workspace
- Be realistic about what you can accomplish

### Making the Most of Local Storage

**Understand the benefits:**

- Your data stays private on your device
- No internet required after initial page load
- Lightning-fast performance with no server delays
- Complete control over your information

**Work within the limits:**

- localStorage typically provides 5-10MB of storage
- This supports thousands of tasks for most users
- If you reach limits, clear completed tasks or delete old entries

## Troubleshooting

### Tasks Not Saving

**Problem**: Your tasks disappear when you refresh the page.

**Solutions**:

1. **Check browser settings**: Ensure localStorage is enabled
2. **Verify browser mode**: Private/Incognito mode may not persist data
3. **Check storage quota**: Clear some browser data if storage is full
4. **Try a different browser**: Rule out browser-specific issues

### Application Won't Load

**Problem**: The page doesn't display or shows errors.

**Solutions**:

1. **Refresh the page**: Press F5 or click your browser's refresh button
2. **Clear browser cache**: Remove cached files and reload
3. **Check JavaScript**: Ensure JavaScript is enabled in browser settings
4. **Update browser**: Use the latest version for best compatibility
5. **Try another browser**: Test if the issue is browser-specific

### Performance Issues

**Problem**: The application feels slow or laggy.

**Solutions**:

1. **Clear completed tasks**: Remove unnecessary data
2. **Reduce task count**: Archive or delete old tasks you no longer need
3. **Close other browser tabs**: Free up system resources
4. **Restart browser**: Fresh start can resolve memory issues
5. **Update browser**: Ensure you're running the latest version

### Can't Edit or Delete Tasks

**Problem**: Task action buttons don't respond.

**Solutions**:

1. **Click directly on icons**: Ensure you're clicking the correct area
2. **Check for edit mode conflicts**: Close any open task edits first
3. **Refresh the page**: Reload to reset the application state
4. **Clear browser cache**: Remove any corrupted cached data

### Mobile Display Issues

**Problem**: The app doesn't look right on mobile devices.

**Solutions**:

1. **Rotate device**: Try both portrait and landscape orientations
2. **Zoom to 100%**: Ensure browser zoom is at default level
3. **Use supported browser**: Test with Chrome Mobile or Safari
4. **Update browser**: Mobile browsers need regular updates too

## Privacy and Data

### Where Your Data Lives

All your task data is stored exclusively in your browser's localStorage. This means:

- **No servers**: Your data never leaves your device
- **No accounts**: No registration, login, or personal information required
- **No tracking**: We don't collect analytics or usage data
- **Complete privacy**: Your tasks are visible only to you

### Data Persistence

Your tasks persist across browser sessions as long as:

- You're using the same browser on the same device
- You haven't cleared browser data/localStorage
- You're not using private/incognito browsing mode
- You haven't uninstalled or reset your browser

### Data Portability

**Important limitations:**

- Tasks are stored per-browser, per-device (no cloud sync)
- Switching browsers or devices means starting fresh
- No built-in export or backup functionality in version 1.0
- Clearing browser data will permanently delete your tasks

**Recommendations:**

- Use the same browser consistently for continuous access
- Manually copy task lists if switching devices
- Consider keeping important tasks in multiple places
- Don't rely solely on this app for critical information backup

### Security

The application implements the following security measures:

- **XSS Prevention**: React's built-in escaping protects against script injection
- **Domain Isolation**: localStorage is restricted to the application's domain
- **No External Calls**: No data transmission to external servers
- **Client-Side Only**: All processing happens in your browser

## Browser Compatibility

### Fully Supported Browsers

The application has been tested and works optimally on:

- **Desktop**: Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari (latest 2 versions)
- **Mobile**: iOS Safari, Chrome Mobile (latest versions)
- **Tablets**: Same as mobile, with enhanced tablet-optimized layouts

### Feature Requirements

Your browser must support:

- **JavaScript ES6+**: Modern JavaScript features
- **localStorage API**: Browser storage mechanism
- **CSS3**: Modern styling capabilities
- **Flexbox**: Layout technology

### Known Limitations

- **Internet Explorer**: Not supported (use Edge instead)
- **Very old browsers**: Versions older than 2019 may have issues
- **Private browsing**: Data won't persist across sessions
- **Third-party browser restrictions**: Some hardened browsers may block localStorage

## Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Do I need to create an account?**

A: No! The application requires no registration, login, or account creation. Just open it and start using it.

**Q: Does the app work offline?**

A: Yes! After the initial page load, the application works completely offline. Your tasks are stored locally and don't require an internet connection.

**Q: Is my data private?**

A: Absolutely. All data is stored locally in your browser and never transmitted anywhere. We don't collect, store, or share any information.

**Q: Can I access my tasks from multiple devices?**

A: Not in version 1.0. Tasks are stored in each browser's localStorage, so they're device and browser-specific. Cloud sync may be added in future versions.

### Task Management Questions

**Q: How many tasks can I create?**

A: The application supports thousands of tasks, limited only by your browser's localStorage quota (typically 5-10MB).

A: Not in version 1.0. Tasks appear in the order you created them. Consider adding numbers or priority indicators to task titles if ordering is important.

**Q: Can I add due dates or categories?**

A: Not in version 1.0. The app focuses on simplicity. These features may be added in future versions.

**Q: Can I undo a deletion?**

A: No. Deleted tasks are permanently removed. Consider marking tasks as complete instead of deleting them if you want to keep a record.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What happens if I clear my browser data?**

A: Clearing browser data or localStorage will permanently delete all your tasks. Always be cautious when clearing browser storage.

**Q: Why does the app use a retro theme?**

A: The retro aesthetic provides a unique, nostalgic user experience that stands out from typical modern applications while maintaining simplicity and usability.

**Q: Can I change the theme or colors?**

**Q: The app is running slowly. What should I do?**

A: Try clearing completed tasks, closing other browser tabs, or restarting your browser. The app is optimized for performance but can slow down with very large task lists.

**Q: The app doesn't work in my browser. What now?**
